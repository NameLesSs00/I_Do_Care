            sorry about that. Also, I made it to remind myself that I did my

            I felt that because I really didn&apos;t mean to hurt you. You don&apos;t
            know me well, and this is not who I am. I am better than that, and
            I didn&apos;t want everything to end like this. Let this website be the
            thing that tells you that I really didn&apos;t mean to hurt you. Let me
            explain myself, and then you can make the choice if you would like
